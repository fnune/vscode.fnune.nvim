# `vscode.fnune.nvim`

A fork of [Mofiqul/vscode.nvim](https://github.com/Mofiqul/vscode.nvim) with
modifications following my personal preference, and a darker light mode.
Onlookers are advised to use the original instead.

This fork will try to keep up with upstream changes. See
[`.github/workflows/sync-fork.yml`](.github/workflows/sync-fork.yml).

## Changes

- Interface elements that are not critical should have lower contrast with the background
  - Window borders
  - Scrollbars
- Comments should not be green, but grey
- The light theme should be a little bit darker
